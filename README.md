# Arena-Allocator-Assignment
- This is my arena allocator assignment for my Operating Systems class (CSE3320)
- The makefile produces 6 executables:
  - unit_test
  - benchmark1
  - benchmark2
  - benchmark3
  - benchmark4
  - benchmark5
- unit_test runs a series of tests on the allocator to make sure it runs properly
- benchmark1-benchmark4 test each different allocation method. Allocation methods are as follows:
  - `NEXT_FIT`
  - `BEST_FIT`
  - `FIRST_FIT`
  - `WORST_FIT`
- benchmark5 tests the same code but using malloc instead of the arena allocator
- Each benchmark outputs an integer representing the time in milliseconds that the program took to execute
